# Personal Portfolio

## Description

Here is my portfolio website after gaining basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Along with the introduction of using grids and flex-box. This portfolio will serve as a showcase for my upcoming projects and the skills and techniques learnt on the EdX Front-End Developer bootcamp and beyond. In the aid to help gain employment in the development world.

I struggled to create a hamburger menu and get it working on the mobile version of the site. I will continue to work on this and hopefully get that working in the near future.

As I work through this bootcamp I will continually revisit my portfolio and update accordingly.
